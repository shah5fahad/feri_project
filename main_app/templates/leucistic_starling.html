                            We report a leucistic Indian Pied Starling (Gracupica contra) observed in Keonjhar District, Odisha, India. In contrast to albinism, the individual's large white feathers and preserved black soft-part pigmentation (normal eye and bill) were consistent with leucism, a partial loss of melanin deposition.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            According to the published record, this is one of the few reports of leucism in G. contra from eastern India and the first recorded case from Keonjhar. The observation was made on 17 December 2024 in the Samantaraypur Sasan area (21.62°N, 85.59°E) of Keonjhar city.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The bird's overall body was predominantly white with a dirty-blackish cap, black primaries and black tail. The throat and back were also white in color. The basal parts of the upper and lower mandibles were orange, but the distal parts were whitish. Skin around the eyes was orange and the eyes were of reddish color. Its legs were pale-pinkish.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In addition to field documentation and a brief differential diagnosis that distinguishes leucism from albinism and progressive greying, this note also addresses the potential ecological and conservation significance of these pigment abnormalities.
